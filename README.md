Being in the market for a Nikon camera lens, I scraped data from Nikon's [online lens catalog](http://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/camera-lenses/all-lenses/index.page) using python. 

I created [this Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/NikonSuperTelephotoLenses/NikonSuperTelephotoLenses?:language=en&:retry=yes&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link) to compare prices and specifications.

### Next Steps:

Investigate the most important features that drive lens prices.
