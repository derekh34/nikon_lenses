# nikon_lenses

The purpose of this project is to pull data from Nikon's [online catalog](http://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/camera-lenses/all-lenses/index.page) and export to a .csv. This .csv output will be connected to a [Tableau visualization](https://public.tableau.com/views/Nikon_Lenses/Dashboard2?:embed=y&:display_count=yes).

# How to:

Run clean_data.ipynb to generate .csv file.
