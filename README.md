# nikon_lenses

Being in the market for a Nikon camera lens, I scraped data from Nikon's [online lens catalog](http://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/camera-lenses/all-lenses/index.page) using python. I created [this Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Nikon_Lenses/Dashboard2?:embed=y&:display_count=yes) to compare prices and specifications.

# How to:

Run clean_data.ipynb to generate .csv file.

# Possible Next Steps:

Investigate the most important features that drive lens prices.
